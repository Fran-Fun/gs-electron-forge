			// These lines initialize and configure the engine.

			// While the engine is ready, the game assets have not been loaded
			// yet. The final step is to begin loading the game.
			// We have a few options:

			// 1. Begin loading game assets immediately, from the default game
			// location, and then start the first scene soon as it is complete.
			// This is the simplest option with just one line.
			engine.play();


			// 3. Begin loading the game in the background, but do not
			// immediately start the first scene.
			// Instead, we will delay starting the game until some user event,
			// such as waiting for them to click a button. This is an open ended
			// choice, so implementations will vary.
			// A very simple example might look like this below.
			// Notice we pass a path to the load() function and then later call
			// the play() function without any arguments. You just need a
			// reference to the engine object, either in this closure scope or
			// with a global variable.
			// If you choose this route, you might want to tinker with the
			// loading animation code so that you get the right visual experience.

			// begin loading...
			//engine.load('path/to/game/directory');

			// register a click listener to start the game
			//document.getElementById('gse-player').addEventListener('click', function() {
			//	engine.play();
			//});


			// 4. Neither load nor play the game immediately. Like the previous
			// option, this can be very open ended. For example, maybe you want
			// to play a video clip first, and then load the game.
			// You can defer calling engine.load() and engine.play() in response
			// to whatever JavaScript events suits your design.
